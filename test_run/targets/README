                MB-pol 2-body terms

mbpol-2b.tar.gz : implementation of the potential

ccpol-hbb2-mbpol.pdf : comparison of the CCpol-8sf, HBB2 and MB-pol
                       against CCSD(T)/CBS data from the MB-pol
                       training set

ts-*-.xyz : short-range tranining set used for the 2-body part of the MB-pol;
            two body interaction energy for each configuration is listed
            in the comment line of the XYZ frames (in kcal/mol); the training
            set consists of four parts of different origin: "ccpol" dimers
            are from JCP 128, 094314 (2008); "stationary" dimers include
            10 stationary points and their neighborhoods; "pimd-run10?"
            samples are extracted from NVT PIMD simulation of liquid water
            at ambient conditions under the HBB2-pol potential
